## Research question

Deep Learning in the Woods: what can we learn about canopy height from optical remote sensing?

### Hypothesis

1. The model has not learned a connection of spectral values to canopy height.  
2. Other variables like location and biome play a more important role.  

## Results

#### Colour blind friendly result plots


## Data

These are the 11 tiles that were used for the analysis of the model. They were choosen to be distributed globally, cover multiple different biomes and based on the presented tiles by the original paper.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: false

library(tmap)
library(sf)

tiles <- st_read("../resources/data/not_final_tiles.gpkg", quiet = TRUE)

tmap::tmap_mode("view")
tmap::tm_shape(tiles) +
  tmap::tm_borders(col = "red", lwd = 2) +
  tmap::tm_text("Name", size = 0.8, col = "black")+
  tmap::tm_view(
                basemaps = c("Esri.WorldImagery", "OpenStreetMap"),
                set.view = c(10.0, 20.0, 2))  # longitude, latitude, zoom level

```
