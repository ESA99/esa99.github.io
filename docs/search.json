Central question of the work is What can be learned about canopy height from optical remote sensing.\n\nHypothesis\n\nThe model has not learned a connection of spectral values to canopy height.\n\nOther variables like location and biome play a more important role."

    "text": "Results\nThe preliminary results already show no clear trend after spectral manipultation (Fig. 1). Differences between tiles have shown to be more significant than spectral manipulation, suggesting that the actual influence of spectral properties in the creation of the prediction is very low or none. Relationships between the location of the image tile and the predicted canopy height could already be observed. They will be properly analysed and shown at a later stage of this project.\n\n\n\nFig. 1: Average difference to the original prediction for all manipulated bands and degrees of manipulation.\n\n\n\nColour blind friendly result plots\nSoon to come:)"
