    "text": "Methods\nThis research builds on the model architecture created by Lang et al. (2023). Their promising global canopy height prediction model serves as a great base for investigating the mechanisms behind optical data canopy height predictions. By observing changes in the resulting predic- tions, after manipulating the input data, we would expect to detect (linear) patterns, if spectral properties would provide a strong explainatory value.\nConsistent with the original paper, Sentinel-2 data and ESA-WordCover data from 2020 was used. The code was mainly left unchanged and one function added to allow controlled manipulation of single input bands. A workflow was created in a single script to allow easy application,"

    "text": "Results\nThe preliminary results already show no clear trend after spectral manipulation (Fig. 1). Differences between locations have shown to be more significant than spectral manipulation, suggesting that the actual influence of spectral properties in the creation of the prediction is very low or none. Relationships between the location of the image tile and the predicted canopy height could already be observed. They will be properly analysed and shown at a later stage of this project.\n\n\n\nFig. 1: Average absolute relative difference to the original prediction by degree of manipulation, for all bands and locations."

Using the old solver can take hours or even fail due to conflicts.\nminiforge3 is installed via Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh Important: Solver has to be set to libmamba. Check via conda info and change like this if needed:\nconda info | grep solver\nconda config --set solver libmamba\n\nInstallation\nSet the desired software/packages and if needed versions in environment.yml. All undefined Versions will be fitted to work together. Create the Virtual Environment with the specified requirements.\nTip: Installing R inside the environment avoids mismatches between Python and R libraries and ensures your scripts are reproducible across machines.\nmamba env create -f environment.yml\n\nCheck after installation\nTo see all installed software and packages with their exact version use conda list or filter for a specific item\nconda list\n\nconda list | grep numpy"
